# C++ 14/17/20 Personal Challange Days

*Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance you shall keep moving* :smile:

## About this project
This personal project started on 27.03.2023 with previous experience in coding. 

## Scope
The scope of this project is to keep a consistent learning schedule for myself and keep track of the new concepts in C++.

## Objectives
- [ ]  reach at least 30 days challanges
- [ ]  reach at least 20 books, websites or video references
- [ ]  OOP 
	- [ ]  static and dynamic polimorphism
	- [ ]  casting operators
- [ ]  STL
- [ ]  Smart Pointers
- [ ]  Graph Theory
- [ ]  

## Content

Days.h -> base class

Day1.h -> implements Days.h 

	std::uint32_t Challange::Day1<uint32_t>::doChallange(const char* fmt, ...) 
where the challange is to find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the provided parameter value number

Day2.h -> implements Days.h 
		
	std::uint32_t Challange::Day2<uint32_t>::doChallange(const char* fmt, ...) 
where the challange is to sum Fibonacci sequence

Day3.h -> implements Days.h 

	std::vector<int> Challange::Day3<std::vector<int>>::doChallange(const char* fmt, ...)
where the challange is to implement symmetric difference using std::set_symmetric_difference[^1]

Day4.h -> where the template recursion is presented[^2]
